# Assignment 1
This program is written in Java and uses 8 threads to compute the prime numbers up to 10^8. To compile and run the program, navigate to the folder in which the program is stored and open up a command line terminal. Then write:\
javac Assignment1.java\
java Assignment1\
\
The program will create a file in the same folder called primes.txt and print the output of the program to the file. If an exception occurs during file I/O an error will be printed to the console.\
\
An example output file is also included in this repository, as well as a a brief summary of my approach and an informal statement reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of my design.
